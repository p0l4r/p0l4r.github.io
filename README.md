This is the repository of my personal website.

## Files
This repository includes everything needed for my static website.
1. index.html
2. style.css
3. cv.pdf

## Future plan
I am planning to create something more robust and dynamic in the next few iterations. Ideas are always welcomed. A personal website with a blog should be my ultimate goal for this project. But not now, because I need to study for my exam. Hahahaha.
